This is a bit about how I made my first open-source contribution, and why it was awesome.

At the time, I’d just taken a [distributed systems course](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-440/S14/syllabus.html) where I learned a lot of go. One thing I really liked about go was the intensity with which it enforces a styleguide. `gofmt` was one of the manifestation of this; the command-line tool, distributed alongside go's runtime, would reformat your code so that it matched go's styleguide. Go would also do a lot of way more aggressive things, like failing to compile if you have the nerve to put your `else` statements on their own line. 

At any rate, `jsfmt` is developed to be, at a high level, the `gofmt` for javascript, with a bunch of other cool stuff like smart code pattern matching and rewriting. It was a project I found value in. Better yet, it was the middle of winter break and I was restless. So, I looked through the open issues for something I could tackle and saw that they needed a [landing page](https://github.com/rdio/jsfmt/issues/19).

I threw together a site and 

If you get nothing else from this article, realize that contributing to an open-source project is really easy. It’ll take some time to contribute meaningful work, but if it’s a project you’re passionate about, that shouldn’t stop you.
